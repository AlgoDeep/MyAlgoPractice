The JOIN operation

11. For every match involving 'POL', show the matchid, date and the number of goals scored.

SELECT matchid, mdate, count(*)
FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
where team1 = 'POL' or team2 = 'POL'
group by matchid, mdate                  # when select mdate, need to add mdate to group by!
