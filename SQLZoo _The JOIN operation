The JOIN operation

11. For every match involving 'POL', show the matchid, date and the number of goals scored.

SELECT matchid, mdate, count(*)
FROM game JOIN goal ON matchid = id 
where team1 = 'POL' or team2 = 'POL'
group by matchid, mdate                  # when select mdate, need to add mdate to group by!


13.
List every match with the goals scored by each team as shown. This will use "CASE WHEN" which has not been explained in any previous exercises.

SELECT mdate,
  team1,
  sum(CASE WHEN teamid=team1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) score1,
  team2,
  sum(case when teamid=team2 then 1 else 0 end) score2
  FROM game LEFT JOIN goal ON matchid = id     # must be left join since some match doesn't have goals
group by mdate, team1, team2
order by mdate, matchid, team1, team2
